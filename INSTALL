doesn't work, it's almost certainly my fault, not Steve's, so bother
me not him. - Trever

=============================================================
Please read:

This is meant to provide a non-administrative, single-email-address
interface to the MailWatch database -- and only a SIMPLE one
at that.

In particular, this interface has no support for searching, no
way to let a user view a detail page for a message, and no way
for a user to release a message from quarantine or to run sa-learn.
Those features *will* be added later.

So what is this good for then, you may be asking...

It's good for letting a user determine whether a message they
never received was blocked by MailScanner.  That was my original
primary objective, since at my site we don't notify senders
OR recipients when a message is blocked - it just goes into the
quarantine, where it sits for a few days till it's deleted.  In
such a set-up the only other way for a user to figure out that
mailscanner blocked a message is to ask the email admin to check
on it for him.

Requirements:

If you have mailwatch working, then you ought to be able to get
this working.  You'll have to add a "lusers" table to the
mailscanner database to hold "lusernames" (described below).

Authentication:

For "luser" authentication, a new table, "lusers", is created
in the mailscanner database.  Lusernames are actually email
addresses and passwords are pseudo-randomly generated.  There
is no provision for letting a user set their own password, 
although they can get a new random password at any time.

There is no provision for intergrating the authentication
with another user database, such as Active Directory or the
/etc/passwd file.  That's intentional - everything's a whole
lot simpler (and safer) if access restrictions are based only
on the email address in question.

A user initially connects to the login page and then clicks on
"create an account", which prompts him for his email address.
A message containing a random password is sent to that email
address.  If they user doesn't own the address, they never get
the password.

A note about "random" passwords:

With the routine included for generating passwords, the resulting
passwords are more likely to be easy to remember than they would
be if they were truely random.  We use patterns to produce
"pronounceable" passwords.  Sometimes however some passwords
might raise an eyebrow or too - there's nothing that can be
done to prevent that, but just be aware of it.  For example, if
the president of your company gets his password randomly set
to "m0ron12" and takes it personally... well, I doubt he'll
forget it, and that's the whole point. ;^)

INSTALL instructions:

- Untar the files into a luser directory underneath your
  /var/www/html/mailscanner directory.  The directory
  should be modes u=rwx,go=rx, owned by whatever owns your
  /var/www/html/mailscanner directory.

	chown root:root /var/www/html/mailscanner/luser
	chmod u=rwx,go=rx /var/www/html/mailscanner/luser

- Create a symbolic link from luser_login.php to index.php
	cd /var/www/html/mailscanner/luser
	ln -s luser_login.php index.php

- Create the lusers table, which will hold "lusernames":
	mysql mailscanner <create_lusertable.sql

  (You'll probably need to add the -u and -p options to that command,
  as appropriate for your mysql set-up.  For example:
	mysql -uroot -prootpass mailscanner <create_lusertable.sql

- Update the following settings within luser_functions.php:

   // Who should password change messages appear to come from?
   // Don't forget to whitelist this address.
   define(LUSER_PASSCHANGEFROM, 'password_change@yourdomain.com');
   
   // Which domains do we serve?  This list should include any
   // domain that you want "lusers" to be able to use this
   // interface for.
   global $luser_allowed_domains;
   $luser_allowed_domains=array('somedomain.com','some.otherdomain.com');

- Add the address you defined for LUSER_PASSCHANGEFROM to your
  MailScanner whitelist, if appropriate for your site.  (This may not
  be required if you already whitelist the mailwatch server by
  ip address.)

- If you have MAILQ set to true in mailscanner/functions.php, you'll
  probably want to change that to false.  The Mail Queue table doesn't
  make much sense for a non-administrative user.
